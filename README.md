# Group 4 - Serotonin Synapses

# Project - Employee Promotion

### Business Overview
A large Multinational Corporation( MNC) has 9 broad verticals across the organisation. One of the problems is identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and preparing them in time. The final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to new roles. Hence, the company needs help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.
Weâ€™ll therefore be analysing the given data and creating various models with the aim of finding the best one to use in identifying the most eligible candidates for promotion.

### Business Objective
Study the factors that contribute to an individual getting promoted, and then create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict whether candidates get promoted or not ahead of time given certain predictor variables.

### Business Success Criteria
The model will be considered a success when it is able to consistently and accurately predict the target variable with an accuracy of 85-90%. The range ensures that we have a well performing model while also avoiding overfitting.
